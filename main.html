    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm by determining how its execution time increases with input size.
        The terms <b>time complexity</b> and <b>efficient</b>
        are crucial in evaluating algorithm performance.
    </p>

    <p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm 
        requires to execute. It is denoted using Big-O notation, 
        such as <b>O(n)</b>. The concept of <b>Space Complexity</b>
        helps in understanding how memory usage grows with input size.
