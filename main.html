    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, your goal should be to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizing it and make it more efficient.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For Example, if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
