     <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing the efficiency of an algorithm by determining how its execution time increases with input size.
		The terms <b>time complexity</b> and <b>efficient</b>
		are crucial in evaluating algorithm performance.</p>
<p>Space complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm 
	requires to execute. It is denoted using Big-O notation, 
	such as <b>O(n)</b>. The concept of <b>Space Complexity</b>
	helps in understanding how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
